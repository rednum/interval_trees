# Introduction
This is a variant of interval tree data structure. This name may not be technically correct - please see last paragraph for explanation.

This tree allows following operations (each runs in O(log N) complexity):
- insert a segment with some weight
- count sum of weights of segments in a given point

Therefore the name pointsum tree - it allows you to find sum of intervals in a point.

# Usage

Short example below. Please refer to examples/pointsum.rs for bigger example.

```rust
use interval_tree::pointsum::{PointSumTree};

fn main() {
    let mut t = PointSumTree::new(1, 10);
    assert_eq!(t.bounds(), (1, 10));
    t.insert(1, 5, 1);
    t.insert(5, 6, 21);
    assert_eq!(t.query(1), Some(1));
    assert_eq!(t.query(2), Some(1));
    assert_eq!(t.query(5), Some(21));
    assert_eq!(t.query(6), Some(20));
    assert_eq!(t.query(9), Some(0));
}
```

# Naming

I'm not sure what is the correct name for this data structure - I learned it
in my algorithm class under polish name "drzewo przedzia≈Çowe", which could be
translated to something like "interval tree". However, it seems like it
slightly differs from standard interval tree implementation - instead
of storing all intervals, I keep only interval weight in nodes (which
makes it less flexible but improves complexity). It's also rather easy to 
generalize this structure to work like canonized interval tree.
